# MultiParadigm-GameEngine
We're tasked with making two abstract game engines each of them capable of running any one of the six board games; Chess, Connect 4, 8 Queens, Tic Tac Toe, Sudoku, and Checkers. Each game engine is made using a different programming paradigm. One is made using OOP in Java Script, and the other using functional paradigm in Scala.
