# MultiParadigm-GameEngine

- We're tasked with making two abstract game engines each of them capable of running any one of the six board games; Chess, Connect 4, 8 Queens, Tic Tac Toe, Sudoku, and Checkers. 

- Each game engine is made using a different programming paradigm. One is made using the Object Oriented Paradigm in Java Script, and the other using the functional paradigm in purely functional (state-free) Scala.

- The game engines are designed to only be resposible for drawing the board, enforcing game rules, alternating turns, and validating user input. But it can be easily extended to add win conditions and score systems.

- Using the logic paradigm in Prolog, we added some Prolog files which can solve single-player puzzle games like Sudoku & 8 Queens. The Prolog code is linked with the Scala engine to provide the user with ability to solve the puzzle at any solveable state.
